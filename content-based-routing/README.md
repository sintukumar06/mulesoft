# Content-Based Routing

You can look through and run this example application to learn the basics of using Anypoint Studio to route messages in a flow by using a *Choice* router.

This example application performs the following actions:

1. Listens for messages.
1. Passes messages to a *Set Variable* component that sets the variable `language` to the language that is passed in the message by the parameter `language`.
1. Uses a  *Choice* router to find out whether each message contains a `language` attribute. The presence and value of this attribute determine how the *Choice* router routes the message:

  - If the value is `French`, the router routes the message to a *Set Payload* component that is named *Reply in French*. This latter component returns the message `Bonjour!` to the requester.
  - If the value is `Spanish`, the router routes the message to a *Set Payload* component that is named *Reply in Spanish*. This latter component returns the message `Hola!` to the requester.
  - If the message contains no `language` attribute, the router routes the message to the default path, which is a subflow that:

    1. Logs the message "No language specified. Using English as a default." to the console
    1. Sets the value of `language` to `English`.
    1. Returns the message `Hello!`.

This example demonstrates that, when you are planning to route messages in a flow by using a *Choice* router, there are four aspects to planning that you need to consider:

* The content that the *Choice* router evaluates to determine how it routes messages
* The number of routes
* The default routing option
* The processing that the flow performs for each routing option

### Set Up and Run the Example

1. Open the _Content-Based Routing_ project in Anypoint Studio. If you don't have Anypoint Studio installed, you can download it [here](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/studio).
2. In the application in Studio, click the **Global Elements** tab.
1. Double-click the HTTP Listener global element to open its **Global Element Properties** dialog.
1. Change the contents of the **Port** field to 8081, if it is not set to that port already.
1. Click each component in the message flow and view its properties.
1. Click **Configuration XML** at the bottom of the editor and familiarize yourself with the XML of the application.
3. Run the project by right-clicking its main folder and selecting **Run As > Mule Application**.
4. Open any web browser, paste the following URL in the address bar, and press Enter:

        http://localhost:8081/?language=Spanish

      **Result:** Your browser presents a message that reads "Hola!".
   Check the console log in Studio and look for a log message that is similar to this one:

         INFO  2017-09-08 13:24:01,695 [[MuleRuntime].io.03] org.mule.runtime.core.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: The reply "Hola!" means "hello" in Spanish.

5. In your browserâ€™s address bar, replace the current URL with this one, and then press Enter:

        http://localhost:8081/?language=French

      **Result:** Your browser presents a message that reads "Bonjour!". Check the console log in Studio again and look for a log message that is similar to this one:

            INFO  2017-09-08 13:26:01,695 [[MuleRuntime].io.03] org.mule.runtime.core.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: The reply "Bonjour!" means "hello" in French.

6. Try accessing `localhost:8081` without specifying a language:

        http://localhost:8081

    **Result:** Your browser presents a message that reads "Hello!".
Check the console log in Studio again and look for a log message that are similar to these:


        INFO  2017-09-08 13:27:01,691 [[MuleRuntime].io.03] org.mule.runtime.core.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: No language specified. Using English as a default.

        INFO  2017-09-08 13:27:01,695 [[MuleRuntime].io.03] org.mule.runtime.core.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: The reply Hello! means "hello" in English
